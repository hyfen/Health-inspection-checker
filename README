# Foursquare <-> Dinesafe

This app grabs your foursquare checkin history and checks which of your favourite venues in Toronto have failed their health inspections.

## Where to get the data

Archives of Dinesafe health inspections are available on [Toronto's Open Data site](http://www.toronto.ca/open/datasets/dinesafe/). 

### Converting the XML dumps to SQL

The data comes in the form of gigantic XML dumps from Dinesafe's own databases. A conversion script is available in <code>script/dinesafe-xml2csv.rb</code>

### Future plans

[Dinesafe's official web](http://app.toronto.ca/food2/index.jsp) site has up-to-date information on health inspections as they happen. Instead of waiting for reports to get archived and posted to Toronto.ca/open, a scraper could allow this app to include much more recent results.

## Geocoding

Using the address column in the <code>Establishments</code> table, you can get coordinates for each restaurant. I opened up the CSV in Google Refine and added coordinates using [these instructions](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/Geocoding). Make sure to add ",toronto,ontario" to the end of the query since the Dinesafe database only includes street address.

	"http://maps.google.com/maps/api/geocode/json?sensor=false&address=" + escape(value, "url") + ",toronto,ontario"

Google allows 2500 geocoding requests per day. The latest Dinesafe XML dump represents about 10,000 establishments so geocoding all of them will take a few days.
